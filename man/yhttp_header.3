.Sh DESCRIPTION
Obtain the value of a certain header field or query string identified by
.Fa name
or
.Fa key
from the HTTP request
.Fa requ .
.Pp
Because both values are stored in hash tables internally, look-ups are O(1).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Both functions return a
.Vt "char *"
containing the value of that field
or
.Dv NULL
if the field has not been set.
.Pp
The value itself is in the format as it was provided the client, meaning that
it may be necessary to pass it to
.Xr yhttp_url_dec 3 .
.Pp
Query string pairs that have a name but an empty value are being returned as
a zero-length string.
